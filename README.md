Here’s a complete rewrite of the README.md file for my React + Vite project with Tailwind CSS installation and details about the packages used:

React + Vite + TailwindCSS Template
This template provides a minimal setup for building a React application using Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast refresh, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and ESLint for code linting.

Features
Vite: Ultra-fast development and build tooling.
React: Latest version for building modern UI components.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without leaving your HTML.
ESLint: A pluggable linter tool for ensuring code quality.
